##### 1. CPU load monitor on the Pi-Lite display
Using [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/tree/master/scripts) for python, polls cpu load, extracts the digits and maps them on the tiny display. The Pi-Lite is currently attached to my pi3, but will soon be fitted onto a desktop case via an [RTK.GPIO](https://ryanteck.uk/electronics/166-rtkgpio.html).
